Run it in browser
=================

1.  You gotta install cordova::

        $ sudo npm -g install cordova

2.  You gotta add "browser" as a platform::

        $ cordova platform add browser

3.  Now you can fire up the app in your browser, like so::

        $ cordova run browser

And now you should hopefully see your browser open
http://localhost:8000/ or something like that, and you'll see a goofy
robot and a green blinking button "device is ready".

Here is a fun fact... if you alter some of the HTML code in www/, and
then reload the browser, too bad!  You won't see your changes.  You
gotta do this::

    $ cordova prepare browser

Or, just kill the process running in the "cordova run browser" tab and
rerun it.

You'll remember to do this most of the time, but not always, and you'll
start going crazy when you're wondering why stuff isn't changing.

Build stuff with build.phonegap
===============================

This is how you can build the executables suitable for installing on the
phone.
