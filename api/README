Read INSTALL for installation instructions.

StuhGang should be renamed to whatever you want
your project name to be.

Two steps:

1. Rename all files and folders from stuhlgang to your project's name::

    # The shopt globstar let's us do recursive using **
    # if we have bash 4.0 or >

    shopt -s globstar
    rename -n 's/stuhlgang/new_project_name/' **

2. Rewrite the contents of each file, substituting stuhlgang for your
   project's name::

    find profiles -type f -exec sed -i 's/stuhlgang/new_project_name/g' {} \;

Now you should be ready to follow the rest of the INSTALL instructions.

Just remember, to substitute 'stuhlgang' for your project's name.
